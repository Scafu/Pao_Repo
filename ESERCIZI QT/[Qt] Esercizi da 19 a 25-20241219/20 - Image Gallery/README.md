# Instructions
## Add Resources:
- Embed at least three images into the resources.qrc file.

## Complete the TODOs:
- Populate imagePaths with the paths of the images embedded in the resource file.
- Populate imageSelector with corresponding image names (e.g., "Image 1", "Image 2").
- Implement the displayImage function to load and set the QPixmap for the imageLabel.

## Test Shortcuts:
- Verify that Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right navigate between images.
- Ensure the combo box updates when navigating via shortcuts.

## Optional Enhancements:
- Add an option to load images from the file system in addition to the resource file.
- Add a zoom feature for the images.
